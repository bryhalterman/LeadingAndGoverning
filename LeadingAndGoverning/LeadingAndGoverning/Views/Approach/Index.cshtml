                    When working with public purpose boards and organizations, our approach illuminates the visions, values, conflicts and choices ever present when governing in the public square.
                    We help leaders work together to create public solutions with staying power.

                        <p>
                            Just as we can use a compass or a map or the Global Positioning System to show us where we are and where we want to go,
                            the public values of liberty, equality, community and prosperity can likewise illuminate our policy positions and guide our public decision making.
                            These values represent the republican and democratic aspirations of American Democracy, helping us see more clearly where we are,
                            where we would like to go, and how we might get there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We make public decisions to resolve public conflicts.
                            Public conflicts arise when we attach priority to different public values (We want to go different places).
                            Public choices arise when we must decide which value or values should have priority, and how all of the values represented should be balanced (We choose where to go).
                            Policy solutions are the tools or means we use to navigate public conflicts and achieve our aspirations (We decide how to get there).

                        Chart a course to implement your solution that best navigates all of the values involved. Remember that when dealing with the pull of multiple values the shortest distance between where you are and where you decide to go may not be a straight line.l
