                    "I found your workshop to be a cut above the rest,...
                    the model you developed for balancing values and choices (has) a very strong element of truth to it; a lot of depth.
                    The honesty in the thinking that goes behind the model is what drives that."

                    I am running for a second term...and want...to present these thoughts clearly enough so that my audience will understand I am not 'running against' but am 'running for' our entire district.
                    Thank you again."

                    "I attended an all day workshop entitled Public Problems, Democratic Decisions: The Role of Mayors and Council Members, which was excellent.
                    The premise of the program was that our democratic system has a built-in tension...(that) forces all issues out into the open...
                    which in turn can and should lead to responsible decision making."

                    Your Stepping Up to the Plate without Crossing the Line: Democratic Leadership for Public Executives workshop was the most valuable training session I have ever taken...
                    I am going to apply the lessons learned to the difficult problems we are currently facing in my community."
